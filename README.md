# Kindle Clippings to CSV

Easily adaptable program to convert your clippings into a CSV file.

## Requirements

- This program has only been tested for the [**Kindle 5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_5). Other devices' files may have another structrue.
- For this program to work the clippings file **must be in Spanish**.

## Known issues

- If the clipping has a semicolon then the CSV may have some issues.

## Future work

- Add suport for an ebook that my friend owns.
- Add conversion to a nice latex file that does chapters per years or per author. If the purpose is printing it physically, years make more sense.
