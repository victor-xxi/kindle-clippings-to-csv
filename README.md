# Kindle Clippings to CSV

Easily adaptable program to convert your clippings into a CSV file.

## Language
- The code is wrote in English
- The input file is expected to be in Spanish.
- The output file (the headers of the csv) is in Catalan.

## Requirements

- This program has only been tested for the [**Kindle 5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_5). Other devices' files may have another structrue.

## Known issues

- If the clipping has a semicolon then the CSV may have some issues.

## Future work

- Add suport for an ebook that my friend owns.
- Add conversion to a nice latex file that does chapters per years or per author. If the purpose is printing it physically, chapters by years make more sense as it's easier to update.
